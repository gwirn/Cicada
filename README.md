## Installation
[Install rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Change the directory path to an absolute path so calender can be run from everywhere for these 3 files:
* The date storage file
https://github.com/gwirn/Cicada/blob/f1811ff85513f3fa2fdfc6f9d35b60199185e90f/src/main.rs#L13
* The file containing the password used for de-/encrypting the date storage file
https://github.com/gwirn/Cicada/blob/f1811ff85513f3fa2fdfc6f9d35b60199185e90f/src/main.rs#L15
* The file containing the salt for the password
https://github.com/gwirn/Cicada/blob/f1811ff85513f3fa2fdfc6f9d35b60199185e90f/src/main.rs#L14

Run `cargo build --release` to create a binary of the program.

If you want a faster version go back to this ab2af0cb14e9f06685caa38b1500de6ce6059b2f commit. The file ecryption makes it slower.

The default mode of the calendar is just the current month.
The current day is highlighted in bold green.
A red âˆ† on the right side of the day indicates an appointment.

To check your calendar continously you can set a job in [crontab](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/crontab.1.html) that runs `calendar check` every n minutes to get alerts for upcoming events.
